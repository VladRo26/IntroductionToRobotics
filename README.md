# IntroductionToRobotics

## My Journey

Hey there, I'm Turis Gavriil-Vlad, a passionate computer science student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. At 21 years old and currently in my third year, I'm thrilled to share my robotics journey, made at course named: Introduction To Robotics with you through this GitHub repository.

### About Me:

I'm passionate about technology, especially about robotics. This repository is my digital workshop for coding experiments and projects. It's where I refine my coding skills and delve into the world of robotics. Join me in discovering the exciting world of machines and tech.

### What You'll Find Here:

This repository is dedicated to my coursework in the "Introduction to Robotics" lab. It serves as a record of my learning process, containing all the elements required for each assignment: detailed instructions, code implementations, associated images, and technical specifics.

### Homework 2

#### Task:

### Homework 3

#### Task:
This assignment involves simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using
LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino. By the end of this task, you will gain
experience in using button state change, implementing debouncing techniques,
and coordinating multiple components to represent real-world scenarios.

### Components :
-LEDs (At least 4: 3 for the floors and 1 for the elevator’s operational
state)
-Buttons (At least 3 for floor calls)
-Buzzer (1) - optional for Computer Science, mandatory for CTI
- Resistors and wires as needed

NOTE: I SOLVED THE PROBLEM WITH THE BUZZER QUITE SOUND !
IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE RESISTOR USED FOR BUZZER, I TRIED TO USE A 100 OHM RESISTOR BUT IT ACTUALLY WAS 5K =).
THE ELEVATOR HAS ALL THE THREE SOUNDS.

### Homework 4

#### Task:
You will use the joystick to control the position of
the segment and ”draw” on the display. The movement between segments
should be natural, meaning they should jump from the current position
only to neighbors, but without passing through ”walls”.

### Components :
1 7-segment display, 1 joystick, resistors and wires (per
logic)

### HomeWork 6

#### Task:
Develop a ”Smart Environment Monitor and Logger” using Arduino. This system will utilize various sensors to gather environmental data, log this data into
EEPROM, and provide both visual feedback via an RGB LED and user interaction through a Serial Menu. The project focuses on integrating sensor readings,
memory management, Serial Communication and the general objective of building a menu. 

#### Components :

• Arduino Uno Board
• Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
• LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) aka Photocell aka Photoresistor aka Light
Sensor
• RGB LED
• Resistors as needed
• Breadboard and connecting wires
