# IntroductionToRobotics

## My Journey

Hey there, I'm Turis Gavriil-Vlad, a passionate computer science student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. At 21 years old and currently in my third year, I'm thrilled to share my robotics journey, made at course named: Introduction To Robotics with you through this GitHub repository.

### About Me:

I'm passionate about technology, especially about robotics. This repository is my digital workshop for coding experiments and projects. It's where I refine my coding skills and delve into the world of robotics. Join me in discovering the exciting world of machines and tech.

### What You'll Find Here:

This repository is dedicated to my coursework in the "Introduction to Robotics" lab. It serves as a record of my learning process, containing all the elements required for each assignment: detailed instructions, code implementations, associated images, and technical specifics.

### Homework 2

#### Task:
This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue)
of an RGB LED using individual potentiometers. By the end of this task,
you will gain experience in interfacing potentiometers with the Arduino and
controlling RGB LEDs based on the analog readings.

#### Components: 
- RGB LED (At least 1)
- Potentiometers (At least 3)
- Resistors and wires as needed
